# Rationale
This home staging website is designed to help, inform, and attract both homeowners and home builders by offering a clear, easy-to-use, and visually appealing online platform.

- It explains the meaning of home staging, why it’s helpful, and how it works.
- It makes it easy for users to book a visit, ask questions, or request a quote.
- It builds trust by showcasing reviews from happy clients and photos of past work.
- It is responsive on all devices, like phones, tablets, and computers.

### Target Audience
- Homeowners who want to sell their homes.
- Home builders who want to show off new houses or model homes.

### Motivation
This website was created to solve a common problem that many homeowners and home builders face:

From the user stories above, we can see that the following pain points exist:

- Difficulty getting a clear, quick estimate for home staging services
- Lack of Visual Proof - users are unsure if the staging matches their brand, property style, or target market.
- Users usually have unanswered questions about the home staging process
- Users are often uncertain about whether the service is reliable or worth the investment.
  
This project was therefore insired by the need to make things clearer and easier. The website gives users simple information, examples of past projects, and easy ways to take action.
The main goal is to help users feel confident and informed, so they can make better choices that improve how well their property sells.

### Background

Home staging—preparing and decorating a property to make it more appealing to potential buyers—has become an increasingly popular strategy to enhance a home's marketability and perceived value. 

Research has shown that homes that are staged usually sell more quickly and for more money than those that are not. But many homeowners don’t really know what home staging is, how it works, or how it can help them sell their homes. Because of this, they may feel unsure or miss out on good oppurtunities.This website was created to solve this issue. It helps users understand home staging, shows examples of past projects, and makes it easy to contact the staging team.
